# Navigation
Navigation is an important concept to understand when building mobile apps.
It's good to know the tradeoffs between the different navigation option types in React Native

**Some Options:**
- [React Navigation (RN)](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) - Simple yet powerful solution provided by react native. All JS implementation. Pretty easy to setup
- [React Native Navigation (RNN)](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) - Provides 100% native platform navigation on both iOS and Android, provided by Wix. Slightly more complex to setup
- [Other](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=react+native+navigation&type=Repositories)

# Implementation
- [React Native Navigation (RNN)](documentations/navigation/navigation-RNN.md)
- React Navigation (RN) - not implemented for this project

# TODOs:
- Utilize redux to separate out logic
- Separate out registration portion from index.js
- Remove the 'text' on back navigation
- setup for Android
- better 'setRoot' layout
